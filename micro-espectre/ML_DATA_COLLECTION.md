## Supported Hardware

**Recommended chips for ML data collection:**
- ESP32-S3
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-C6

**Also supported:**
- ESP32 (original) - Does not support AGC gain lock, but data is usable for ML training (raw std is used for all chips)

> **Note**: AGC gain lock stabilizes CSI amplitudes during data collection. Without it, amplitudes vary with signal strength. The ML training pipeline and MLDetector always use raw std (`σ`) for turbulence, regardless of gain lock status. CV normalization (`σ/μ`) is only used by MVS detection.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment

Before running any command, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
cd micro-espectre
source ../venv/bin/activate  # Your prompt should show (venv)
```

### 2. Flash and Deploy (First Time Only)

If you haven't already flashed the firmware:

```bash
./me flash --erase
./me deploy
```

### 3. Start CSI Streaming

Start streaming CSI data from ESP32 to your PC:

```bash
./me stream --ip <your_pc_ip>
```

**Features:**
- Gain lock phase (~3s) for stable CSI acquisition
- 64 subcarriers (HT20 mode)
- Sequence numbers for packet loss detection
- ~100 packets/second

### 4. Optional: Inspect Live ML Motion Detection

If you want to validate runtime ML behavior before recording data, run live
host-side inference from the UDP CSI stream:

```bash
./me detect --log-turbulence
```

`me detect` reads threshold, subcarriers, Hampel, low-pass, and hit filtering
from `src/config.py` and `src/config_local.py`, just like the rest of
micro-ESPectre. Use `--bind-ip <local_ip>` only when auto-detection picks the
wrong interface.

---

## Data Collection with `me collect`

The `me collect` subcommand provides a streamlined workflow for recording labeled CSI samples.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `./me collect --label <name> --duration <sec>` | Record for specified duration |
| `./me collect --label <name> --samples <n>` | Record n samples interactively |
| `./me collect --label <name> --contributor <user>` | Override contributor (auto-detected from git) |
| `./me collect --label <name> --description "text"` | Add description to sample |
| `./me collect --info` | Show dataset statistics |

Gain lock status is **automatically detected** from the CSI stream and saved in `dataset_info.json`.

### Recording Samples

```bash
# Record 60 seconds of baseline (contributor auto-detected from git config)
./me collect --label baseline --duration 60

# Record 30 seconds of movement
./me collect --label movement --duration 30

# Record with explicit contributor override
./me collect --label gesture --samples 10 --interactive --contributor otheruser

# Gain lock status is auto-detected from the CSI stream
# No need to specify --no-gain-lock, it's automatic!
./me collect --label baseline --duration 10
```

### Viewing Dataset

```bash
./me collect --info
```

Output:
```
  Label                   Samples
  --------------------------------
  idle                         12
  wave                         10
  swipe                        10
  ...
  --------------------------------
  Total                        47
```

File naming convention: `{label}_{chip}_{num_sc}sc_{timestamp}.npz`

### Dataset Info (dataset_info.json)

Central metadata file for the dataset:

```json

}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `filename` | NPZ file name |
| `chip` | ESP32 chip type (C6, S3, ESP32) |
| `subcarriers` | Number of subcarriers (64 for HT20) |
| `contributor` | GitHub username of data collector |
| `collected_at` | ISO timestamp of collection |
| `duration_ms` | Sample duration in milliseconds |
| `num_packets` | Number of CSI packets |
| `gain_locked` | `true` if AGC gain lock was active during collection |
| `description` | Human-readable description |

### Sample Format (.npz)

Each `.npz` file contains a minimal, compact format optimized for ML training:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `csi_data` | `int8[N, SC*2]` | Raw I/Q data (N packets × SC subcarriers × 2) |
| `num_subcarriers` | `int` | Number of subcarriers (64 for HT20) |
| `label` | `str` | Sample label (e.g., "baseline", "movement") |
| `chip` | `str` | ESP32 chip type (e.g., "c6", "s3") |
| `gain_locked` | `bool` | Whether AGC gain lock was active during collection |
| `collected_at` | `str` | ISO timestamp of collection |
| `duration_ms` | `float` | Sample duration in milliseconds |
| `format_version` | `str` | NPZ format version ("1.0") |

Amplitudes and phases can be computed on-the-fly from `csi_data`:

```python
# Espressif CSI format: [Imaginary, Real, ...] per subcarrier
Q = csi_data[:, 0::2].astype(float)  # Imaginary (Q) at even indices
I = csi_data[:, 1::2].astype(float)  # Real (I) at odd indices
amplitudes = np.sqrt(I**2 + Q**2)
phases = np.arctan2(Q, I)
```

### Loading Data

```python
import numpy as np

# Load single sample
data = np.load('data/baseline/baseline_c6_64sc_20251212_142443.npz')
csi_data = data['csi_data']        # Shape: (N, 128) for 64 subcarriers
label = str(data['label'])         # 'baseline'
num_sc = int(data['num_subcarriers'])  # 64

# Compute amplitudes from raw I/Q data
# Espressif CSI format: [Imaginary, Real, ...] per subcarrier
Q = csi_data[:, 0::2].astype(float)  # Imaginary (Q) - Shape: (N, 64)
I = csi_data[:, 1::2].astype(float)  # Real (I) - Shape: (N, 64)
amplitudes = np.sqrt(I**2 + Q**2)    # Shape: (N, 64)
phases = np.arctan2(Q, I)            # Shape: (N, 64)
```

### Using csi_utils

```python
from tools.csi_utils import load_npz_as_packets
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np

# Load a sample file (run from micro-espectre/)
packets = load_npz_as_packets(Path('data/baseline/baseline_c6_64sc_20251212_142443.npz'))

for pkt in packets:
    csi_data = pkt['csi_data']           # Shape: (128,) - raw I/Q data
    label = pkt['label']
    
    # Calculate amplitudes from I/Q pairs
    Q = csi_data[0::2].astype(float)     # Imaginary (odd indices)
    I = csi_data[1::2].astype(float)     # Real (even indices)
    amplitudes = np.sqrt(I**2 + Q**2)    # Shape: (64,)
    # Process...
```

## Data Without Gain Lock

Some ESP32 chips (original ESP32) or data collection sessions may not have AGC gain lock enabled. This causes CSI amplitudes to vary with signal strength rather than just motion.

### How It Works

The ML training script uses **raw std** for all chips, including those without gain lock. CV normalization is not applied during ML training or inference — it is only used by the MVS detector.

### When CV Normalization Is Applied

CV normalization is only used by the **MVS detector**, not by ML:
- **ESP32 (original)**: MVS uses CV normalization since AGC gain lock is not supported
- **Data collected before enabling gain lock**: MVS applies CV normalization for older captures
- **Future compatibility**: Any data where amplitudes are unreliable

### Automatic Detection

The collector **automatically detects** the gain lock status from the CSI stream:

1. The ESP32 firmware sends a `gain_locked` flag in each UDP packet
2. The collector saves this flag in the `.npz` file
3. `dataset_info.json` stores `gain_locked: false` when gain lock was not applied

No manual flags needed - the system handles everything automatically!

### Viewing Files with CV Normalization

```bash
python tools/10_train_ml_model.py --info
```

This shows which files use CV normalization.

---

## Best Practices

### Recording Guidelines

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Duration** | 30-60 seconds per sample (1500-3000 packets @ 50 pps) |
| **Repetitions** | 10+ samples per label for variability |
| **Environment** | Same environment for all samples in a session |
| **Position** | Vary position/distance between samples for robustness |
| **Labels** | Use lowercase, no spaces (e.g., `wave`, `swipe_left`) |

### Label Naming Convention

```
# Good labels
idle
wave
swipe_left
swipe_right
push
pull
circle_cw
circle_ccw

# Avoid
Wave          # uppercase
swipe left    # spaces
gesture1      # non-descriptive
```

### Session Workflow

1. **Prepare environment**: Ensure room is quiet for baseline
2. **Record baseline first**: `./me collect --label baseline --duration 60`
3. **Record movement**: `./me collect --label movement --duration 60`
4. **Verify dataset**: `./me collect --info`
5. **Backup data**: Copy `data/` to safe location

Note: Contributor is auto-detected from `git config user.name`. Use `--contributor` to override.

---

## Analysis Tools

After collecting data, use the analysis scripts in `tools/`:

```bash
cd tools

# Visualize raw CSI data
python 1_analyze_raw_data.py

# Test MVS detection on your data
python 3_analyze_moving_variance_segmentation.py --plot
```

See [tools/README.md](tools/README.md) for complete documentation of all analysis scripts.

---

## Training the ML Model

Once you have collected labeled data, train the ML model:

```bash
# Train model (default uses --fp-weight 1.0, --scaler standard, --batch-size 32)
python tools/10_train_ml_model.py

# Show dataset info (including excluded files)
python tools/10_train_ml_model.py --info

# Compare alternate feature normalization modes
python tools/10_train_ml_model.py --scaler clipped_standard

# Optional chip-exclusion experiment
python tools/10_train_ml_model.py --exclude-chip ESP32
```

The `--fp-weight` parameter multiplies the IDLE class weight during training. Values >1.0 reduce false positives at the cost of slightly lower recall. Current defaults: `--fp-weight 1.0`, `--scaler standard`, `--batch-size 32`.

This will:
1. Load all `.npz` files from `data/`
2. Use raw std for all files (CV normalization disabled for ML)
3. Apply context-aware MVS-guided sample weighting on the default subcarrier set
4. Extract 9 features per sliding window
5. Run grouped cross-validation by paired capture/session, with blocked scoring to reduce overlap optimism
6. Report worst-group metrics (session, chip, source file) alongside mean fold metrics
7. Train the selected MLP architecture with early stopping and dropout
8. Export to:
   - `src/ml_weights.py` (MicroPython) - includes seed and timestamp
   - `components/espectre/ml_weights.h` (C++/ESPHome) - includes seed and timestamp
   - `models/motion_detector_small.tflite` (TFLite int8)
   - `models/feature_scaler.npz` (normalization params)
   - `models/ml_test_data.npz` (blocked regression subset for inference validation)

Use `--seed <number>` for reproducible training. The seed is saved in the generated weight files.

> **Note**: The ML pipeline always uses raw std for turbulence, regardless of `gain_locked` status. CV normalization is only applied by the MVS detector at runtime.
>
> **Note**: `--exclude-chip` is an experiment knob for ablations and domain-isolation studies. The default training path keeps all supported chips in the dataset unless you explicitly exclude them.
>
> **Note**: `ml_test_data.npz` is an inference-regression artifact, not the primary model-selection metric. Architecture and scaler choices should follow the grouped blocked-CV report emitted by `10_train_ml_model.py`.
>
> **Tip**: `--scaler clipped_standard` and larger `--batch-size` values are available for exploratory sweeps, but should be validated against `tests/test_validation_real_data.py::TestPerformanceMetrics::test_ml_detection_accuracy` before being promoted to production artifacts.
>
> **Tip**: For production artifact promotion, prefer `python tools/10_train_ml_model.py --seed-search-until-improvement <N>` over a plain training run. A plain run always exports the current seed, while the seed-search flow only replaces artifacts after a strict grouped-CV improvement.

### Compare Detection Methods

After training, compare ML with MVS:

```bash
python tools/7_compare_detection_methods.py
```

Add `--plot` to visualize results graphically.

### Using the ML Detector

Set in `config.py`:

```python
DETECTION_ALGORITHM = "ml"
```

For algorithm details, see [ALGORITHMS.md](ALGORITHMS.md#ml-neural-network-detector).

## Advanced: Custom CSI Receiver (Optional)

For custom real-time processing, you can use `CSIReceiver` as a library:

```python
from csi_utils import CSIReceiver

def my_callback(packet):
    # packet is a CSIPacket dataclass with:
    # - timestamp: Reception timestamp (seconds since epoch)
    # - seq_num: Sequence number (0-255)
    # - num_subcarriers: Number of subcarriers (64 for HT20)
    # - iq_raw: Raw I/Q values as int8 array
    # - chip: Chip type (e.g., 'c6', 's3') - auto-detected from stream
    print(f"Chip: {packet.chip}, Seq: {packet.seq_num}, SC: {packet.num_subcarriers}")

receiver = CSIReceiver(port=5001)
receiver.add_callback(my_callback)
receiver.run(timeout=60)  # Run for 60 seconds
```

### UDP Packet Format

```
Header (7 bytes):
  - Magic: 0x4353 ("CS") - 2 bytes
  - Chip type: 1 byte (0=unknown, 1=ESP32, 2=S2, 3=S3, 4=C3, 5=C5, 6=C6)
  - Flags: 1 byte (bit 0 = gain_locked)
  - Sequence number: 1 byte (0-255, wrapping)
  - Num subcarriers: 2 bytes (uint16, little-endian)

Payload (N × 2 bytes):
  - I0, Q0, I1, Q1, ... (int8 each)

Example (HT20, 64 SC):
  - 7 + 128 = 135 bytes
```

The `gain_locked` flag indicates whether AGC gain lock was applied during data collection. MVS uses this flag to enable CV normalization when gain is not locked. ML ignores this flag and always uses raw std.

Note: ESPectre uses HT20 mode (64 subcarriers) for consistent performance across all ESP32 variants. Chip type and gain lock status are automatically detected and included in each packet.
