## [2.8.0] - in progress - Detection quality hardening, ML cross-chip robustness, and CI security

### Highlights

- **Detection quality and calibration robustness improved across stacks**: NBVI now uses multi-strategy band selection with stricter defaults, aligned adaptive validation, tighter hint-band fallback, unified 12-subcarrier defaults, and a curated validation dataset.
- **ML reliability improved on cross-chip generalization**: all per-chip datasets were recollected from scratch with stricter quality controls; training now uses chip-aware grouped validation, hard-positive mining, updated features, retrained weights aligned with the default runtime filter chain, and a more gradual temperature-scaled Movement Score for Home Assistant.
- **Security and CI governance hardened**: CodeQL and DCO enforcement were added, workflow permissions were tightened, and emulated-target CI was stabilized and simplified.
- **New S3 display-board profile**: added a dedicated `ESP32-S3 Touch LCD 1.47"` example with tuned display settings and on-device motion status output.

### Runtime and algorithm changes (highest impact)

- **Hampel now enabled by default**: `hampel_enabled=true` with threshold `5.0 MAD` (from `4.0`) to suppress extreme spikes while preserving motion sensitivity.
- **NBVI strategy selection expanded**: each window evaluates four candidates (Entropy Spaced, MAD Clustered, Classic Spaced, Classic Clustered) and selects the lowest-FP option; scoring now exposes `nbvi_classic`, `nbvi_entropy`, and `nbvi_mad`.
- **ML Movement Score is now more gradual**: the published ML metric now uses temperature scaling before the sigmoid so Home Assistant sees intermediate values instead of an almost pure 0/10 on-off signal. The default 5.0 threshold remains the binary decision boundary, so detection behavior and validation targets stay unchanged while the score becomes more informative for dashboards and automations.
- **Motion binary publish path is now centralized and edge-driven**: Home Assistant motion state changes are emitted immediately on `IDLE <-> MOTION` transitions instead of waiting for the periodic metric publish cadence, and the new `motion_on_hits` / `motion_off_hits` options allow configurable consecutive-hit filtering without duplicating logic across MVS and ML detectors. Defaults are now `3 / 3`.
- **Detector evaluation cadence is now configurable and decoupled from periodic publishing**: runtime state updates now run on a separate `evaluation_interval` (default `25` packets), while periodic metric/log publication still follows `publish_interval`.
- **Micro-ESPectre runtime is aligned with the firmware cadence/filter model**: the Python device loop now applies the same decoupled `evaluation_interval` plus `motion_on_hits` / `motion_off_hits` filtering before publishing MQTT state, `info` reports the new runtime knobs, and `./me deploy` now includes the new `runtime_policy.py` module.
- **Default detection window increased to 100 packets**: the shared runtime default (`DETECTOR_DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE` / `SEG_WINDOW_SIZE`) now uses a 100-packet window, with regenerated ML artifacts and aligned docs.

- **NBVI defaults and validation tightened**: `alpha` 0.5->0.75, `percentile` 10->5, `noise_gate_percentile` 25->15; calibration FP is now measured with the runtime-consistent adaptive threshold (`P95 x 1.1`).
- **Hint-band fallback made conservative**: hint/current band is now also kept when both the calibrated candidate and the hint/default band already satisfy the <=5% FP target and the hint is not meaningfully worse on that proxy. This prevents over-conservative NBVI bands from replacing a known-good default on datasets such as ESP32-C5.
- **Python/C++ real-data pairing aligned**: the native C++ test harness now uses full ISO timestamps including fractional seconds when choosing nearest baseline/movement pairs, matching the Python path and removing false regressions caused by second-level truncation.

### ML and dataset pipeline

- **CV normalization disabled for ML**: MLDetector now always uses raw std (`σ`) for spatial turbulence, regardless of `gain_locked` status. CV normalization (`σ/μ`) remains active only for MVS. This fixes a distribution mismatch where ESP32 (gain_locked=false) produced CV-normalized features (~0.05-0.15) incompatible with the raw std scale (~2-8) used by gain-lock chips, corrupting the StandardScaler and degrading ESP32 ML recall to ~11%. With this fix, ESP32 ML reaches 99.6% recall / 0.2% FP (F1 99.7%) in Python validation while all supported chips stay above 99% ML F1.
- **Training leakage protections added**: CV moved from `StratifiedKFold` to `StratifiedGroupKFold` (grouped by chip), and internal validation split is explicitly stratified.
- **Hard-positive mining added**: subtle near-threshold motion samples are up-weighted to improve worst-chip recall.
- **Feature set refreshed**: `turb_delta` was replaced by `waveform_length` after cross-chip correlation/SHAP validation.
- **Model and runtime chain re-aligned**: ML weights were retrained using Hampel-filtered input to keep train/deploy behavior consistent.
- **Datasets recollected for all chips**: previous captures were replaced with new recordings under stricter quality controls (gain-locked, 128SC HT20-only, balanced baseline/motion ratios); the new dataset is used across the full pipeline — NBVI validation, MVS performance tests, and ML training.
- **Validation quality controls tightened**: strict targets (`recall >95%`, `FP <5%`) were enforced for `test_mvs_default_subcarriers`.
- **Collection and reporting consistency fixes**: interactive collector now drains queued packets with monotonic timing; dataset quality pair totals now use the same rounded ratio logic as per-pair checks.

### Security, CI, and tooling

- **Governance and SAST**: moved contribution governance to DCO commit-signoff enforcement and kept a dedicated CodeQL workflow for C++/Python.
- **Micro-ESPectre tooling hardening**: replaced insecure temporary-file usage, improved UDP bind safety with environment-aware host handling, and added `--bind-ip` to `./me collect`.
- **CI reliability and maintainability**: QEMU smoke tests now handle known PHY emulator limits, restore ESP32 coverage, remove unsupported C6 matrix entries, and consolidate local test config paths.
- **Permission and dependency hygiene**: workflows now declare explicit `contents: read` where required; Dependabot update grouping was tuned to reduce PR noise.
- **Baseline versions and runtime tooling updated**: example/QEMU configs now require `min_version: 2026.2.0`; ESPHome was updated to `2026.3.0` with measured flash/heap/loop-time improvements.

### Examples and documentation

- **Added**: `examples/espectre-s3-touch-lcd.yaml` for Waveshare-compatible 1.47" S3 boards.
- **Added**: `micro-espectre/notebooks/01_csi_data_explorer.ipynb` and `micro-espectre/notebooks/02_feature_extraction_and_ml.ipynb`.
- **Removed/cleaned**: `examples/uart/`; documented optional `hardware_uart: UART0` usage in classic USB-UART bridge configurations.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-17 - ESPectre configuration over BLE and subcarrier normalization

### Highlights

- **BLE control unlocks standalone integrations**: ESPectre can now be used even without Home Assistant by building custom BLE clients.
- **Runtime threshold is now configurable via BLE**: the current BLE command channel enables live threshold updates and can be extended to additional runtime parameters.
- **Web game moved from Serial to Web Bluetooth**: `docs/game` is now an example BLE client instead of a Web Serial-only path.
- **CSI normalization supports more payload variants**: runtime handling now covers `256->128`, `228->114`, and `114->128` remap paths before HT20 processing.
- **Behavior and validation are aligned across stacks**: ESPHome/C++ and Micro-ESPectre/Python follow the same CSI-length normalization logic, with dedicated tests for `128/256/114/228`.

### Fixed

- **Extended CSI normalization paths (ESPHome/C++ and Micro-ESPectre/Python)**: runtime now consistently handles `256->128` (double HT-LTF), `228->114`, and `114->128` remap paths before HT20 processing, reducing packet drops on short/double CSI payload variants (#93).
- **Cross-stack alignment for CSI length handling**: Micro-ESPectre normalization behavior and runtime logs are now aligned with ESPHome component behavior.

### Added

- **Unit tests for new CSI payload scenarios**: added coverage for `114-byte` and `228-byte` CSI handling in C++ (`test_csi_manager`) and dedicated Python tests for `128/256/114/228` normalization paths (`micro-espectre/tests/test_utils.py`).

### Changed

- **Web game transport migrated to BLE**: `docs/game` now uses Web Bluetooth (desktop Chrome/Edge) with a custom ESPectre BLE service for telemetry (`movement`, `threshold`) and sysinfo notifications, replacing the previous Web Serial path.
- **BLE control channel opened to generic clients**: `docs/game` is now an example client built with the Web Bluetooth API, but ESPectre can be controlled by any standard BLE client implementing the same commands.
- **Legacy USB serial monitor path removed from firmware loop**: USB Serial/JTAG attach detection for game sysinfo emission has been cleaned up as it is no longer needed with BLE transport.
- **Practical BLE benefits documented in this release**: the game/channel flow is now compatible with standard ESP32 boards (no native USB serial/JTAG required), does not require an active wired serial connection, and enables runtime threshold tuning over BLE from any compatible BLE client (not only `docs/game`).

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-08 - ESP32-C5 Support, Context-Aware Calibration, and Stricter Validation Targets

### Highlights

- **More robust runtime on modern chips (ESP32-C5/C6)**: WiFi lifecycle handling is hardened, dual-band protocol/bandwidth APIs are used correctly (with safe fallback), C5 is forced to 2.4 GHz, and C5 CSI `114-byte` payloads are normalized to HT20 `128-byte` internal layout
- **Safer calibration and detector state transitions**: calibration start failures are now handled explicitly, detector buffers are cold-cleared after calibration/channel switches, and NBVI input/band-size validation is hardened
- **Stricter quality bar for motion validation**: Python and C++ performance targets are now unified to `Recall >95%` and `FP <5%` for both MVS and ML, with docs updated accordingly (`PERFORMANCE.md`, `test/README.md`)

### Reliability and Runtime Fixes

- **Threshold handling unified across stacks**: validation is aligned to `0.0-10.0` across ESPHome/C++ and Micro-ESPectre/Python (HA number, Serial, MQTT, detector setters); MQTT now propagates detector rejection correctly; `factory_reset` restores ML threshold to `5.0`
- **Serial command parsing hardening**: `T:<value>` now uses validated `strtof` parsing (`endptr`, finite/range checks)
- **Startup fail-fast behavior**: setup now marks the component failed when WiFi initialization/handler registration fails
- **Auxiliary task stability**: DNS task always clears `running_` on early exits, avoiding stale "already running" states
- **Safety guards in diagnostics utilities**: progress-bar width/marker bounds are now clamped to prevent fixed-buffer edge cases

### Calibration, ML, and Dataset Pipeline

- **NBVI hot-path optimization**: reduced allocations, enforced memory-bounded chunked validation reads (avoids `std::bad_alloc`/`abort()` on low-heap targets), and replaced O(window) shifts with ring buffer + running statistics
- **Context-aware grid-search metadata workflow**: `micro-espectre/tools/11_refresh_gridsearch_metadata.py` introduced and then simplified to a single C++-aligned evaluation path (legacy hardcoded subcarrier override removed)
- **Metadata consistency cleanup**: `gain_locked` is now the single source of truth in `.npz` and `dataset_info.json`; deprecated `use_cv_normalization` and `label_id` metadata removed
- **ML pipeline alignment (training + inference)**: both stacks now use `[12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52]`; models were retrained/re-exported with validated seed, and feature extraction was simplified to the selected 12 runtime features

### Tooling and Developer Experience

- **Micro-ESPectre deploy diagnostics improved**: `./me deploy` now performs a REPL health-check and reports explicit remediation for ROM boot-loop (`invalid header`) with `./me flash --erase`
- **C5 support in `me` CLI expanded**: C5 auto/manual selection, `--chip c5`, correct `esp32c5` target mapping, and C5 firmware artifact selection (`ESP32_CSI_C5.bin`)
- **Flash mapping hardening**: per-chip offsets aligned with MicroPython board deploy options (including C5 `0x2000`)
- **Optional BSSID lock in Micro-ESPectre**: `WIFI_BSSID` support added in `src/main.py`
- **ESP-IDF mock alignment**: WiFi mock headers updated to modern protocol bitmasks, band-mode enums, and dual-band API signatures
- **General cleanup**: removed unused `BaseDetector` amplitude getters and refreshed stale comments/documentation (including C5 tested status in setup/examples, S2 still experimental)
- **ESPHome 2026.2.4 validation**: project configuration was re-validated after upgrading ESPHome from `2026.2.0` to `2026.2.4` (`esphome config examples/espectre-c6-dev.yaml`), with full Python and C++ test suites passing

## [2.5.1] - 2026-02-23 - HT STBC Multi-Antenna Router Fix

### Fixed

- **ESP32-C5/C6 STBC multi-antenna router fix**: Multi-antenna routers with STBC TX send two HT training fields per frame (HT-LTF1 + HT-LTF2), causing the CSI callback to receive 256-byte packets instead of the expected 128 bytes for HT20. On ESP32-C5/C6, `wifi_csi_acquire_config_t` has no field to disable HT STBC capture (unlike older chips). ESPectre now accepts these packets and takes the first 64 subcarriers (HT-LTF1), which is a valid channel estimate (#76, espressif/esp-csi#238)
- **Micro-ESPectre NBVI calibration on ESP32-C3**: Fixed OOM crashes during calibration caused by large in-memory allocations in the streaming NBVI computation phase; calibration now completes successfully on C3 with ~59 KB free heap
- **ESPHome 2026.2.0+ compatibility**: Ensure SPIFFS inclusion for newer ESPHome versions (#87)
- **CI develop branch**: Use local component configs instead of main branch for CI builds on develop

### Changed

- **Micro-ESPectre NBVI calibration speed**: Packet collection rate improved ~3x on ESP32-C3 (28 → 80 pps) by skipping sqrt on guard band subcarriers (excluded from NBVI selection), caching `math.sqrt` locally, and using integer arithmetic in the magnitude loop

### Added

- **Performance documentation**: RAM, Flash, and detection timing benchmarks for ESP32-C3 and ESP32-C6 in PERFORMANCE.md
- **Performance logging**: Lightweight DEBUG-level logging for heap usage (startup/post-calibration) and detection time (~10s interval)
- **git_ref substitution**: All example YAML files now use a `git_ref` substitution, making it easy to switch between branches, tags, or commits
- **Snapshot builds**: Automated pre-release builds on every push to main, providing pre-compiled firmware for testing fixes before official releases

### Documentation

- Clarify that NBVI calibration applies only to MVS mode
- Add media section in README

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-15 - ML Detector, Training Pipeline & Pre-built Firmware

### Highlights

- **ML Detector (Experimental)**: Neural network-based motion detection with ~3s boot time (no calibration needed)
- **Training Pipeline**: Collect data, train, and export models for both platforms
- **Pre-built Firmware**: Ready-to-flash binaries for all 6 ESP32 variants via GitHub Releases
- **PCA & P95 Removed**: Simplified to MVS + ML detectors, NBVI-only calibration

### ML Detector

First experimental release of a neural network-based motion detector, available in both C++ (ESPHome) and Python (Micro-ESPectre).

- **Configuration**: `detection_algorithm: ml` in YAML
- **Performance**: ~97-100% F1 score depending on chip
- **Boot time**: ~3 seconds (vs ~10s for MVS) — no band calibration needed
- **Zero dependencies**: Manual MLP inference, no TFLite required

```yaml
espectre:
  detection_algorithm: ml
```

The pre-trained model shipped with this release was trained on a limited dataset collected in a single environment. It performs well in initial testing, but **we need your help to make it better**. If you try the ML detector, consider contributing baseline (empty room) and movement recordings from your environment — the more diverse the training data, the more robust the model becomes. See [ML_DATA_COLLECTION.md](micro-espectre/ML_DATA_COLLECTION.md) for how to collect and submit data via pull request.

For architecture and feature details, see [ALGORITHMS.md](micro-espectre/ALGORITHMS.md#features).

#### Training Pipeline

Collect labeled data, train a model, and export weights for both platforms:

```bash
./me collect --label <name> --duration <sec>   # Collect data
python tools/10_train_ml_model.py               # Train model
```

Exports `ml_weights.py` (Python), `ml_weights.h` (C++), and TFLite checkpoint. See [ML_DATA_COLLECTION.md](micro-espectre/ML_DATA_COLLECTION.md) for the full workflow.

### Pre-built Firmware & Easy Install

New `release.yml` workflow builds and publishes firmware for all supported chips (ESP32, S2, S3, C3, C5, C6) on every tagged release.

SETUP.md now offers two installation paths:

- **Option A: Web Flash** — Download from Releases, flash via [ESPConnect](https://thelastoutpostworkshop.github.io/ESPConnect/) in Chrome
- **Option B: ESPHome CLI** — Traditional `esphome run` workflow

Based on PR #77 by [@WLaoDuo](https://github.com/WLaoDuo).

### Removed

**PCA Detection Algorithm**: While PCA itself is a well-known statistical technique, our implementation was based on Espressif's open-source esp-radar library. Since Espressif has transitioned this library to closed source, we have removed our PCA implementation to ensure full compliance with our GPLv3 license.

MVS remains the recommended algorithm with excellent performance. Future development will focus on the ML detector, which shows very promising results in early testing and requires no initial calibration.

**P95 Calibrator**: NBVI (Normalized Band Variance Index) is now the sole calibration algorithm. NBVI consistently outperforms P95 by selecting non-consecutive subcarriers for better spectral diversity and resilience to narrowband interference.

### Improvements

- **Gain lock**: Median-based calibration (replaces mean), signed FFT gain fix, CV normalization when gain lock is skipped
- **Bug fixes**: Double amplitude calculation fix, stack allocation in Hampel filter

### Micro-ESPectre (R&D Platform)

- **Extended hardware support**: `me` CLI now supports ESP32, C3, S3, C6 with auto-detection and SHA256 firmware verification
- **ML detector filter support**: ML detector now accepts low-pass and Hampel filter parameters, matching C++ implementation
- **Import standardization**: All `src/` modules now use `try/except ImportError` pattern for MicroPython/CPython compatibility
- **Bug fixes**: Signed int8 CSI parsing, ESP32 flash offset corrected, LowPass default cutoff aligned to 11.0 Hz

### For Contributors

<details>
<summary>Architecture changes and internal improvements</summary>

#### Architecture

- **Calibrator simplification**: Removed `ICalibrator` interface and `BaseCalibrator` base class, merging all functionality into `NBVICalibrator`
- **Window size centralization**: `segmentation_window_size` (default: 75) is now defined in a single source of truth (`DETECTOR_DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE` in C++, `SEG_WINDOW_SIZE` in Python) and passed to both detector and calibrator
- **Calibration buffer size**: Now calculated as `10 × window_size` (default: 750 packets), automatically adapts if window size changes
- **CV normalization**: Both platforms use CV normalization consistently when gain lock is skipped
- **Unified window size in tools**: All analysis tools now use `SEG_WINDOW_SIZE` from `config.py` instead of hardcoded values

</details>

## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-24 - Live Recalibration, Adaptive Threshold & PCA

### Highlights

- **Two detection algorithms**: Choose between MVS (default) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- **Recalibrate from Home Assistant**: New switch to trigger recalibration without reflashing
- **Adaptive threshold by default**: No manual tuning needed - works out of the box

### New Features

#### Dual Detection Algorithms

Two motion detection algorithms are now available:

| Algorithm | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **MVS** (default) | `detection_algorithm: mvs` |
| **PCA** (experimental) | `detection_algorithm: pca` |

#### Calibrate Switch

New Home Assistant switch for triggering recalibration without reflashing:

- `switch.espectre_calibrate`: Turn ON to recalibrate, auto-turns OFF when complete
- Useful after room layout changes or furniture moves

#### Adaptive Threshold

The `segmentation_threshold` parameter is now optional:

- **Default**: Adaptive threshold calculated as P95 × 1.1 during calibration
- **Manual override**: Specify value in YAML to use fixed threshold

### Improvements

#### Dual Band Selection Algorithms

Two automatic subcarrier selection algorithms:

| Algorithm | Method | Configuration |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **NBVI** (default) | 12 non-consecutive subcarriers | `segmentation_calibration: nbvi` |
| **P95** | 12 consecutive subcarriers | `segmentation_calibration: p95` |

#### HT20-Only Mode

Simplified to WiFi 4 (802.11n) HT20 mode for stable 64 subcarriers across all ESP32 variants:

- Consistent performance on C3, C6, S3, and original ESP32
- Reduced memory footprint

#### Other Improvements

- **Lower threshold minimum**: 0.1 (was 0.5) for high-sensitivity applications
- **ESP32-C3 dev config**: Added `espectre-c3-dev.yaml`

### Bug Fixes

- **ESP32-C3 boot crash**: Fixed duplicate `register_component` calls
- **USB Serial JTAG**: Correct ESPHome macro for detection
- **CSI data overflow**: Limit to 128 bytes to prevent overflow

### Micro-ESPectre (R&D Platform)

- **SHA256 firmware verification**: New `verify` command detects outdated firmware
- **CSI Stream Protocol v2**: Auto-detected chip type, contributor tracking
- **Refactored calibrators**: Cleaner architecture with `p95_calibrator.py`, `nbvi_calibrator.py`, `threshold.py`

### For Contributors

<details>
<summary>Architecture changes, testing, and CI/CD improvements</summary>

#### Architecture

- New `IDetector` interface for polymorphic detection (`MVSDetector`, `PCADetector`)
- Centralized threshold calculation in `threshold.h` / `threshold.py`
- Legacy `csi_processor` module removed

#### Multi-Chip Test Suite

Tests run on ESP32-C6 and ESP32-S3 with real CSI data:

| Chip | Recall | FP Rate | F1-Score |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| C6 | 98.8% | 0.0% | 99.4% |
| S3 | 99.1% | 14.3% | 92.9% |

#### CI/CD

- **NPZ data loading**: C++ tests use same NPZ files as Python via [cnpy](https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy)
- **QEMU smoke tests**: Catches crashes on S3, C3, C6 before deploy
- **Stale bot**: Auto-close inactive issues after 30+7 days
- **Coverage threshold**: CI fails below 80%

</details>

### Documentation

- **Roadmap update**: Added 3D Localization in v4.x (30-50cm indoor tracking with phase-coherent antenna array)
- Added Part 2 Medium article link to README
- Updated bug report template with crash debug section
- Added Home Assistant dashboard screenshot to README

## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-31 - End of Year Edition

### ESPectre - The Game 

As a thank you to the community, I'm closing the year with something fun: a browser-based reaction game where your physical movement controls the gameplay through WiFi sensing. No controller needed!

Beyond the fun, it's actually useful for threshold tuning, calibration verification, and coverage testing. Uses Web Serial API (Chrome/Edge) with real-time CSI streaming at ~100 Hz.

**Play now:** [espectre.dev/game](https://espectre.dev/game)

### Features

#### Sensor Entity Customization

Full control over exposed sensor entities with standard ESPHome options: `internal`, `icon`, `filters`, `disabled_by_default`.

```yaml
espectre:
  movement_sensor:
    name: "Movement"
    internal: true
    filters:
      - multiply: 100
  motion_sensor:
    icon: "mdi:motion-sensor"
```

See [#51](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/issues/51).

#### External Traffic Mode

Support for multi-device deployments with reduced network overhead.

- **`traffic_generator_rate: 0`**: Disable internal traffic generator and rely on external WiFi traffic
- **`publish_interval`**: Control sensor update rate independently from traffic source
- **UDP Listener**: Opens port 5555 to receive external UDP packets for CSI generation
- **95% less network overhead**: One broadcast source feeds all ESPectre devices

External traffic source: [`espectre_traffic_generator.py`](examples/espectre_traffic_generator.py) - standalone script with daemon mode and Home Assistant integration.

See [#50](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/issues/50).

#### Traffic Generator Ping Mode

New `traffic_generator_mode: ping` option using ICMP echo requests instead of DNS queries. Use when DNS mode has low packet rates (~18 pps instead of ~100 pps) due to routers not responding to root domain queries.

See [#48](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/issues/48).

#### Gain Lock Mode

New `gain_lock` option to control AGC/FFT gain locking behavior:

- **`auto`** (default): Enable gain lock but skip if signal too strong (AGC < 30)
- **`enabled`**: Always force gain lock (may freeze if too close to AP)
- **`disabled`**: Never lock gain (less stable CSI but works at any distance)

Solves the issue where devices too close to the AP (RSSI > -40 dB) would freeze during calibration. See [TUNING.md](TUNING.md) for AGC threshold details.

### Improvements

#### WiFi Channel Change Detection

Automatic detection and buffer reset when AP switches channel (auto-channel, roaming), preventing false positives from CSI data spikes.

Fixes [#46](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/issues/46).

#### Multi-Window NBVI Calibration

Optimized subcarrier selection with multi-window validation, gain lock phase exclusion (first 300 packets), and updated noise gate percentile (10% → 25%).

#### Calibration Fallback with Normalization

When NBVI calibration fails, normalization is still calculated and default subcarriers [11-22] are used, preventing 2000%+ motion values from missing normalization.

### Platform Support

#### ESP32-C3 Super Mini Tested

Added example configuration `espectre-c3.yaml`. Full feature support including gain lock and NBVI calibration.

#### ESP32 (Original/WROOM-32) Tested

Tested on ESP32-WROOM-32D Mini (CH340). Fixed NBVI calibration not starting on platforms without gain lock.

**Known limitations** (ESP32 original only):
- AGC/FFT gain lock not available
- External traffic generator must start **after** ESP32 connects to WiFi
- Broadcast mode not supported; use unicast instead

See [espressif/esp-csi#247](https://github.com/espressif/esp-csi/issues/247).

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-19 - Gain Lock, Low-Pass Filter & ML Data Collection

### Gain Lock (AGC/FFT Stabilization)

Automatic gain control locking for stable CSI measurements, based on [Espressif esp-csi](https://github.com/espressif/esp-csi) recommendations.

- **Two-phase calibration**: Gain Lock (3s, 300 pkt) → NBVI (~7.5s, 10 × window_size pkt)
- Gain lock happens BEFORE NBVI calibration to ensure clean data
- Eliminates amplitude variations caused by automatic gain control
- Supported on ESP32-S3, C3, C5, C6 (not available on ESP32, S2)
- New files: `gain_controller.h`, `gain_controller.cpp`

### Baseline Variance Normalization

Automatic attenuation for consistent thresholds across devices and environments.

- **Always enabled** - no configuration needed
- During calibration, calculates baseline variance using selected subcarriers
- If baseline > 0.25: attenuate with `scale = 0.25 / baseline_variance`
- If baseline ≤ 0.25: no scaling needed (scale = 1.0)
- Prevents over-amplification of weak signals while taming strong ones
- Removed `normalization_enabled` and `normalization_target` parameters

### Low-Pass Filter

New 1st order Butterworth IIR filter to reduce high-frequency RF noise.

- Cutoff frequency: 11 Hz (human movement: 0.5-10 Hz, RF noise: >15 Hz)
- Reduces false positives in noisy environments (51% → 2%)
- Disabled by default: enable with `lowpass_enabled: true`
- Processing pipeline: Normalization → Hampel → **Low-Pass** → Buffer

### NBVI Improvements

Optimized parameters and restricted search range for better subcarrier selection:

| Parameter | Old | New | Effect |
|-----------|-----|-----|--------|
| `alpha` | 0.3 | 0.5 | Balanced weight between signal strength and stability |
| `min_spacing` | 2 | 1 | Allow adjacent subcarriers for better quality selection |
| `window_size` | 100 | 200 | Larger window (2s) for more stable baseline detection |
| `GUARD_BAND_LOW` | 6 | 11 | Exclude noisy edge subcarriers |
| `GUARD_BAND_HIGH` | 58 | 52 | Exclude noisy edge subcarriers |

Dynamic null subcarrier detection replaces hardcoded lists - adapts to local RF conditions.

### Performance

**Lazy Variance Evaluation**: Moving variance calculated only at publish time.
- ~99% CPU savings for variance calculation
- New API: `csi_processor_update_state()` (C++), `seg.update_state()` (Python)

### Automatic sdkconfig

The ESPHome component now auto-configures all required sdkconfig options:
- `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_CSI_ENABLED`, `CONFIG_PM_ENABLE`, AMPDU settings, buffer sizes, tick rate
- YAML files only need platform-specific options (WiFi 6, CPU frequency, PSRAM)

### ML Data Collection

New infrastructure for building labeled CSI datasets (groundwork for 3.x):
- `me collect` CLI subcommand for recording labeled samples
- `.npz` format for ML-ready datasets
- `csi_utils.py` module with `CSIReceiver`, `CSICollector`, `MVSDetector`

### Configuration Changes

**Removed options** (now automatic):
- `normalization_enabled`, `normalization_target`, manual sdkconfig options

**Default values**: All filters disabled, normalization always active.

**Enhanced logging**: Movement logs now include WiFi channel and RSSI:

```
[I][espectre]: [######--|----] 43% | mvmt:0.43 thr:1.00 | IDLE | 101 pkt/s | ch:3 rssi:-47

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-10 - Made for ESPHome Compliance

### Made for ESPHome Compliance

**All example configurations now meet "Made for ESPHome" requirements**

#### WiFi Provisioning
- **BLE provisioning**: `esp32_improv` for easy setup via ESPHome/HA Companion app
- **USB provisioning**: `improv_serial` for web.esphome.io configuration (not yet supported on ESP32-C5)
- **Captive Portal**: Fallback AP "ESPectre Fallback" for WiFi configuration
- **No hardcoded credentials**: Removed `YOUR_WIFI_SSID` placeholders

#### Dashboard Adoption
- **`dashboard_import`**: One-click adoption from ESPHome Dashboard
- **`project` metadata**: Version tracking for firmware updates

#### Code Cleanup
- Renamed `espectre_component.cpp/.h` → `espectre.cpp/.h`
- Component ID standardized to `espectre_csi`
- Updated `me` CLI: `erase_flash` → `erase-flash` (esptool deprecation fix)

### Performance Optimization

**Unified variance algorithm and optimized Hampel filter across both platforms**

This release focuses on code uniformity between MicroPython and C++ implementations, improving numerical stability and performance.

#### Algorithm Uniformity
- **Two-pass variance**: Both platforms now use the same numerically stable algorithm
  - Formula: `Var(X) = Σ(x - μ)² / n` (more stable than `E[X²] - E[X]²`)
  - Eliminates catastrophic cancellation risk with float32
  - Identical behavior between MicroPython and C++

#### Hampel Filter Optimization
- **C++ (ESPHome)**: Eliminated dynamic memory allocation
  - Pre-allocated static buffers in `hampel_turbulence_state_t`
  - Insertion sort replaces `qsort()` for small arrays (N=3-11)
  - **~20-25μs saved per packet** (no malloc/free overhead)
  
- **MicroPython**: Pre-allocated buffers and circular buffer
  - Eliminated list creation per call
  - Insertion sort for small arrays
  - **~120μs saved per packet**

#### Validation
- New test script `16_test_optimization_equivalence.py` using real CSI data
- Verified with 2000 real CSI packets (baseline + movement)
- Maximum variance difference: 9.41e-14 (effectively zero)

| Change | C++ Impact | MicroPython Impact |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Two-pass variance | Unchanged (already used) | +25μs (acceptable) |
| Hampel optimization | -20-25μs | -120μs |
| **Net improvement** | **-20-25μs/pkt** | **-95μs/pkt** |

### Test Suite & Code Coverage

- **140 test cases** (+72 from 2.0.0) with real CSI data
- **Full device testing**: All tests run on both native and ESP32-C6 via `IWiFiCSI` dependency injection
- **Codecov integration**: Coverage badge, PR comments, 80% threshold
- **84% line coverage**, 94% function coverage
- **Refactoring**: Shared utilities in `utils.h`, configurable `CalibrationManager`

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-06 - ESPHome Native Integration

### Major - ESPHome Native Integration

**Complete platform migration from ESP-IDF to ESPHome**

This release represents a major architectural shift from standalone ESP-IDF firmware to a native ESPHome component, enabling seamless Home Assistant integration.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Extensively tested on ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C6, but bugs may still exist. Community contributions, bug reports, and support for additional ESP32 variants are welcome!

### Two-Platform Strategy

**ESPectre now follows a dual-platform development model:**

| Platform | Role | Focus | Target |
|----------|------|-------|--------|
| **ESPectre** (ESPHome - C++) | Production | Motion detection only | Smart home users, Home Assistant |
| **Micro-ESPectre** (Micro Python) | R&D | Features + Filters for research | Researchers, developers, academics |

**ESPectre** focuses on core motion detection for Home Assistant integration.
**Micro-ESPectre** provides features (variance, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, IQR, spatial_*, temporal_*) and advanced filters (Butterworth, Wavelet, Savitzky-Golay) for research/ML applications.

**New Architecture:**
- **Native ESPHome component**: Full C++ implementation as ESPHome external component
- **Home Assistant auto-discovery**: Automatic device and sensor registration via Native API
- **YAML configuration**: All parameters configurable via simple YAML files
- **OTA updates**: Wireless firmware updates via ESPHome

**Implementation:**
- `components/espectre/`: Complete ESPHome component with Python config and C++ implementation
- Modular C++ architecture: `calibration_manager`, `csi_manager`, `sensor_publisher`, etc.
- Binary sensor for motion detection
- Movement score sensor
- Adjustable threshold (number entity) - controllable from Home Assistant

### Micro-ESPectre

**R&D Platform for Wi-Fi CSI Motion Detection - Pure Python implementation for MicroPython**

Micro-ESPectre is the research and development platform of the ESPectre project, designed for rapid prototyping, algorithmic experimentation, and academic/industrial research. It implements motion detection algorithms in pure Python, enabling fast iterations without compilation overhead.
