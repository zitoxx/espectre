## What is This?

**ESPectre - The Game** is a browser-based reaction game that demonstrates the capabilities of [ESPectre](https://espectre.dev) - a WiFi-based motion detection system.

Instead of using a controller, keyboard, or camera, **your physical movement is detected through WiFi signal interference** analyzed by an ESP32 running ESPectre firmware.

### The Concept

You are a **Spectrum Guardian** - an entity that protects WiFi frequencies from malicious Spectres trying to corrupt them. When an enemy Spectre appears, you must physically move faster than it to dissolve it.

- **Stand still** → You're charging, ready to react
- **Move suddenly** → You attack the Spectre
- **Move too early** → You're detected as a cheater and lose
- **Move too slow** → The enemy hits you first
- **Move harder** → Deal more damage, trigger special effects!

1. Visit `https://espectre.dev/game` in Chrome or Edge
2. Connect your device via BLE
3. Click "Connect" and grant permission
4. Your physical movement controls the game!

**No backend server required.** The browser communicates directly with the ESP32 via BLE.

### UUIDs (Reference Profile)

| Item | UUID | Direction | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| Service | `d33ff46b-2203-4775-bc6f-b3a2c36af8f0` | - | ESPectre BLE service |
| Telemetry characteristic | `119d5cac-48da-4bd9-bfc3-169805868258` | ESP32 -> Browser (`notify`) | Binary payload |
| Sysinfo characteristic | `c8c89ffa-c401-461f-9ffc-942fa04adfe3` | ESP32 -> Browser (`notify`) | Text `key=value` lines |
| Control characteristic | `33ed9214-a8d7-40e8-82d1-c82747dcdc71` | Browser -> ESP32 (`write`) | ASCII commands |

### System Info (ESP32 → Browser)

Sent over BLE notify when requested and at client connect.

```
proto_version=1
chip=esp32c6
threshold=1.20 (auto)
window=75
END
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `chip` | ESP32 chip model (e.g., `esp32c6`) |
| `threshold` | Current motion detection threshold |
| `window` | Segmentation window size (packets) |
| `detector` | Active detector (`MVS` or `ML`) |
| `subcarriers` | Subcarrier selection mode (`yaml` or `auto`) |
| `lowpass` | Low-pass filter status (`on`/`off`) |
| `lowpass_cutoff` | Low-pass cutoff frequency (Hz) |
| `hampel` | Hampel filter status (`on`/`off`) |
| `hampel_window` | Hampel window size |
| `hampel_threshold` | Hampel threshold |
| `traffic_rate` | Traffic generator rate (packets/sec) |
| `publish_interval` | ESPectre publish interval (packets) |
| `evaluation_interval` | Detector evaluation interval (packets) |
| `motion_hits` | Motion enter/exit hit counters (`on/off`) |
| `best_pxx` | Calibration baseline metric used for adaptive thresholding |
| `proto_version` | Game BLE protocol version |
| `END` | Marks end of system info block |

### Data (ESP32 → Browser)

Sent via BLE `telemetry` characteristic notifications.

```
[float32 movement][float32 threshold]
```

### Data Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `movement` | float | Current movement intensity (moving variance, same as Home Assistant sensor) |
| `threshold` | float | Motion detection threshold (from ESPectre config) |

Telemetry uses little-endian `float32` values.

### Control Commands (Browser/Client -> ESP32)

| Command | Description | Limits |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `REQ_SYSINFO` | Requests a fresh sysinfo block | Exact command string |
| `SET_THRESHOLD:X.XX` | Updates runtime threshold | `X` must be finite and in range `0.0-10.0` |

Notes:
- Threshold updates are runtime/session-only and are recalculated at boot.
- Unknown or invalid commands are ignored by firmware (warning logged on device).
- The BLE protocol is reusable by any standard BLE client, not only this game.

### Frame Examples

Telemetry notification (`movement=0.75`, `threshold=1.20`):

```text
00 00 40 3F  9A 99 99 3F
```

Sysinfo notification sequence:

```text
proto_version=1
chip=esp32c6
threshold=1.20 (auto)
window=75
END
```

Control write examples:

```text
REQ_SYSINFO
SET_THRESHOLD:1.80
```

### Movement Detection

The game uses the same threshold as Home Assistant for motion detection:

- **Cheat detection**: `movement > threshold × 1.0` (moving during WAIT phase)
- **Valid hit**: `movement > threshold × 1.2` (moving during MOVE phase)

### Power Calculation

Hit power determines damage and visual effects:

```javascript
const power = movement / (threshold * moveMultiplier);  // moveMultiplier = 1.2
```

| Power | Hit Strength | Damage |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| < 0.5 | None | 0 |
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Weak | 1 |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | Normal | 1 |
| 2.0 - 3.0 | Strong | 2 |
| 3.0+ | Critical | 3 |

This allows gameplay mechanics like:
- Multi-hit enemies requiring several weak hits
- One-shot kills with powerful movements
- Visual feedback based on hit intensity
- Bonus points for stronger attacks

### Enemy Types (Progression)

| Wave | Spectre | Max Reaction Time | HP | Points |
|------|---------|-------------------|-----|--------|
| 1-3 | **Wisp** | 800ms | 1 | 100 |
| 4-6 | **Shade** | 600ms | 2 | 200 |
| 7-9 | **Phantom** | 450ms | 2 | 350 |
| 10-12 | **Glitch** | 350ms | 3 | 500 |
| 13+ | **Void** | 250ms | 3 | 750 |

Enemies with HP > 1 require multiple hits or one powerful hit (power >= HP).

---

## Mouse Fallback

For testing without an ESP32, move your mouse to simulate motion detection.
Move faster for stronger hits - the velocity of your mouse maps to movement intensity.

---

## System Info Panel

After connecting via BLE, the game displays a **System Info** panel showing the current ESPectre configuration:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Threshold | Motion detection threshold |
| Window | Segmentation window size |
| Subcarriers | Selection mode (YAML config or NBVI auto-calibration) |
| Low-pass | Filter status and cutoff frequency |
| Hampel | Filter status |
| Traffic | Traffic generator rate |

This provides immediate visibility into how the device is configured without needing to check ESPHome logs.

---

## Threshold Tuning

The game doubles as a fun way to tune your ESPectre system. The movement bar at the bottom of the screen shows real-time motion data and the current threshold.

**Drag the threshold marker** to adjust sensitivity:

- Drag **left** → lower ESPectre threshold on device (more sensitive)
- Drag **right** → higher ESPectre threshold on device (less sensitive)

Threshold drag sends a BLE control command (`SET_THRESHOLD:X.XX`) and updates ESPectre runtime threshold for the active session.

### Runtime Controls via BLE

- `SET_THRESHOLD:X.XX` updates detection threshold at runtime (session-only)
- `REQ_SYSINFO` requests a fresh sysinfo block

This provides immediate visual feedback:
- See exactly how your movements register
- Test different positions in the room
- Find the sweet spot between false positives and missed detections
- Verify the system works before relying on it for automation
