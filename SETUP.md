### 3. Configure WiFi

After flashing, configure WiFi using one of these methods:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **BLE** (easiest) | Use ESPHome or Home Assistant Companion app |
| **USB** | Go to [web.esphome.io](https://web.esphome.io) → Connect → Configure WiFi |
| **Captive Portal** | Connect to "ESPectre Fallback" WiFi → Configure in browser |

That's it! The device will be automatically discovered by Home Assistant.

---
## Option B: ESPHome CLI (for developers)

### What You Need

**Hardware:** Same as Easy Install above.

**Software:**
- Python 3.12 (⚠️ Python 3.14 has known issues with ESPHome)
- ESPHome 2026.3.0 or newer
- Home Assistant (recommended, but optional)

### 1. Install ESPHome

```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

# Install ESPHome
pip install esphome
```

### 2. Download a configuration file

Download the example configuration for your hardware:

| Platform | Configuration File | CPU | WiFi Chip | PSRAM | Status |
|----------|-------------------|-----|-----------|-------|--------|
| **ESP32-C6** | [espectre-c6.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescopace/espectre/main/examples/espectre-c6.yaml) | RISC-V @ 160MHz | WiFi 6 capable | ❌ | ✅ Tested |
| **ESP32-S3** | [espectre-s3.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescopace/espectre/main/examples/espectre-s3.yaml) | Xtensa @ 240MHz | WiFi 4 | ✅ 8MB | ✅ Tested |
| **ESP32-C3** | [espectre-c3.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescopace/espectre/main/examples/espectre-c3.yaml) | RISC-V @ 160MHz | WiFi 4 | ❌ | ✅ Tested ² |
| **ESP32** | [espectre-esp32.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescopace/espectre/main/examples/espectre-esp32.yaml) | Xtensa @ 240MHz | WiFi 4 | Optional | ✅ Tested ³ |
| **ESP32-C5** | [espectre-c5.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescopace/espectre/main/examples/espectre-c5.yaml) | RISC-V @ 240MHz | WiFi 6 capable | ❌ | ✅ Tested ¹ |
| **ESP32-S2** | [espectre-s2.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescopace/espectre/main/examples/espectre-s2.yaml) | Xtensa @ 240MHz | WiFi 4 | Optional | ⚠️ Experimental |

> **Note**: ESPectre uses WiFi 4 (802.11b/g/n) mode for stable 64 subcarriers and faster calibration, even on WiFi 6 capable chips (C5, C6). This ensures consistent performance across all platforms.
>
> On ESP32-C5, ESPectre also forces `2.4 GHz only` band mode at runtime to avoid unintended 5 GHz association and keep CSI behavior stable.

**Recommendations**:
- **ESP32-C6**: Modern RISC-V platform, good performance, compact form factor
- **ESP32-S3**: Best for advanced applications, future ML features (more memory)
- **ESP32-C3**: Budget-friendly option, compact form factor

These files are pre-configured to download the component automatically from GitHub.

> ⚠️ **Experimental platform**: ESP32-S2 has CSI support but has not been extensively tested. Please report your results on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/discussions)!
>
> ¹ ESP32-C5: `improv_serial` (USB provisioning) not yet supported by ESPHome. Use BLE or WiFi AP provisioning instead.
>
>
> ³ ESP32 (original/WROOM-32): AGC/FFT gain lock is not available on this platform. Band calibration works but CSI amplitudes may have more variance than newer chips.
>
> ⁴ **Boards with USB-UART bridges** (CH340, CP2102, CH343): If you don't see logs after flashing, uncomment the `hardware_uart: UART0` line in the `logger:` section of your configuration file to enable logging on UART0.

### 3. Build and flash

```bash
esphome run espectre-c6.yaml  # replace with your platform's file
```

### 4. Configure WiFi

After flashing, configure WiFi using one of these methods:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **BLE** (easiest) | Use ESPHome app or Home Assistant Companion app |
| **USB** | Go to [web.esphome.io](https://web.esphome.io) → Connect → Configure WiFi |
| **Captive Portal** | Connect to "ESPectre Fallback" WiFi → Configure in browser |

That's it! The device will be automatically discovered by Home Assistant.

## Docker / Home Assistant Add-on

If you run ESPHome in Docker or as a Home Assistant add-on, just download an example file to your config directory.

**Example for Docker with bind mount:**

```bash
# Your docker-compose.yml mounts /home/user/esphome/config:/config
cd /home/user/esphome/config

# Download the configuration file
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francescopace/espectre/main/examples/espectre-c6.yaml

# Run ESPHome
docker compose exec esphome esphome run espectre-c6.yaml

# After flashing, configure WiFi via BLE, USB, or Captive Portal
```

No need to copy any files manually - the component is downloaded automatically from GitHub!

---

## Configuration Parameters

### ESPectre Component

All parameters can be adjusted in the YAML file under the `espectre:` section:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `detection_algorithm` | string | mvs | Detection algorithm: `mvs` (variance) or `ml` (neural network) |
| `traffic_generator_rate` | int | 100 | Packets/sec for CSI generation (0-1000, 0=disabled) |
| `traffic_generator_mode` | string | dns | Traffic generator mode: `dns` (UDP queries) or `ping` (ICMP) |
| `publish_interval` | int | auto | Packets between periodic sensor/log updates (default: same as traffic_generator_rate, or 100 if traffic is 0) |
| `evaluation_interval` | int | 25 | Packets between internal detector state evaluations |
| `motion_on_hits` | int | 3 | Consecutive evaluated hits required before switching the binary sensor to `MOTION` |
| `motion_off_hits` | int | 3 | Consecutive evaluated hits required before switching the binary sensor back to `IDLE` |
| `segmentation_threshold` | string/float | auto | Threshold: `auto`, `min`, or number (0.0-10.0 for both MVS and ML) |
| `segmentation_window_size` | int | 75 | Moving variance window in packets (10-200) |
| `selected_subcarriers` | list | auto | Fixed subcarriers (omit for auto-calibration) |
| `lowpass_enabled` | bool | false | Enable low-pass filter for noise reduction (MVS and ML) |
| `lowpass_cutoff` | float | 11.0 | Low-pass filter cutoff frequency in Hz (5-20) |
| `hampel_enabled` | bool | true | Enable Hampel outlier filter (MVS and ML) |
| `hampel_window` | int | 7 | Hampel filter window size (3-11) |
| `hampel_threshold` | float | 5.0 | Hampel filter sensitivity (MAD multiplier) (1.0-10.0) |
| `gain_lock` | string | auto | AGC/FFT gain lock: `auto`, `enabled`, `disabled` |
| `ble_channel_enabled` | bool/string | auto | Enable BLE telemetry/control channel: `auto`, `true`, `false` |
| `ble_telemetry_interval_ms` | int | 40 | BLE telemetry notify interval in ms (20-500) |

For detailed parameter tuning (ranges, recommended values, troubleshooting), see [TUNING.md](TUNING.md).

### Choosing Detection Algorithm

| Algorithm | How It Works | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-----------|--------------|------|------|----------|
| **MVS** (default) | Variance of spatial turbulence | Low CPU, adaptive threshold | Requires 10s NBVI calibration | General use |
| **ML** | Neural network (MLP 12→24→12→1) | Fast boot (~3s), no calibration | Pre-trained weights, fixed subcarriers | Experimental |

Both algorithms support optional low-pass and Hampel filters on the turbulence stream.

```yaml
espectre:
  detection_algorithm: mvs  # or ml
```

**Threshold ranges (unified for both algorithms):**
- Range: 0.0 - 10.0
- MVS default: `auto` (adaptive based on baseline noise)
- ML default: 5.0 (equivalent to 0.5 probability)

### Integrated Sensors (Created Automatically)

All sensors are created automatically when the `espectre` component is configured. You can optionally customize their names.

| Sensor Config | Type | Default Name | Description |
|---------------|------|--------------|-------------|
| `movement_sensor` | sensor | "Movement Score" | Current motion score on a 0-10 scale (more gradual in ML mode) |
| `motion_sensor` | binary_sensor | "Motion Detected" | Edge-driven motion state (on/off), filtered by `evaluation_interval` and hit counters |
| `threshold_number` | number | "Threshold" | Detection threshold (adjustable from HA) |
| `calibrate_switch` | switch | "Calibrate" | Trigger band recalibration (ON during calibration) |

### Customizing Sensors

All sensor entities support standard ESPHome options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Custom entity name |
| `internal` | bool | If `true`, hide from Home Assistant (still processes data) |
| `icon` | string | Custom MDI icon (e.g., `mdi:motion-sensor`) |
| `disabled_by_default` | bool | Entity disabled until manually enabled in HA |

The `movement_sensor` also supports ESPHome [sensor filters](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#sensor-filters) for data transformation.

- **MVS mode**: publishes the current moving-variance based metric
- **ML mode**: publishes a 0-10 confidence-like score derived from the neural network output
- **ML temperature scaling**: the ML score is intentionally softened before the sigmoid so Home Assistant can show intermediate values instead of a nearly binary 0/10 output

Common filters:

| Filter | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `multiply` | `multiply: 10` | Scale values (e.g., 0-10 → 0-100) |
| `round` | `round: 1` | Round to N decimal places |
| `clamp` | `min_value: 0, max_value: 100` | Limit value range |
| `offset` | `offset: -0.5` | Add/subtract constant |
| `sliding_window_moving_average` | `window_size: 5` | Smooth noisy readings |

See the [ESPHome sensor filters documentation](https://esphome.io/components/sensor/#sensor-filters) for the complete list.

**Example:**

```yaml
espectre:
  movement_sensor:
    name: "Living Room Movement"
    internal: true              # Hide from Home Assistant
    icon: "mdi:sine-wave"
    filters:
      - multiply: 100           # Scale 0-1 to 0-100
      - clamp:
          min_value: 0
          max_value: 100        # Cap at 100%
      - round: 1                # Round to 1 decimal
  motion_sensor:
    name: "Living Room Motion"
    icon: "mdi:motion-sensor"
  threshold_number:
    name: "Living Room Threshold"
```

> **Tip:** Use `internal: true` on `movement_sensor` to reduce data sent to Home Assistant while keeping `motion_sensor` for automations.

---

## Home Assistant Integration

ESPHome provides **automatic Home Assistant integration**. Once the device is flashed and connected to WiFi:

1. Home Assistant will automatically discover the device
2. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **ESPHome**
3. Click **Configure** on the discovered device
4. All sensors will be automatically added

### Entities Created

Entity names are based on the device name in your YAML (default: `espectre`):

- **binary_sensor.espectre_motion_detected** - Motion state (on/off)
- **sensor.espectre_movement_score** - Movement intensity value
- **number.espectre_threshold** - Detection threshold (adjustable from Home Assistant)
- **switch.espectre_calibrate** - Trigger recalibration (ON during calibration)

> **Note:** If you change the device name, replace `espectre` with your device name in automations and dashboards.

### Automation Example

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on light on motion"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.espectre_motion_detected
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.living_room

  - alias: "Turn off light after no motion"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.espectre_motion_detected
        to: "off"
        for:
          minutes: 5
    action:
      - service: light.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: light.living_room
```

**Inactivity alert:**

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Inactivity Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.espectre_motion_detected
        to: "off"
        for:
          hours: 4
    condition:
      - condition: time
        after: "08:00:00"
        before: "22:00:00"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "No movement detected for 4 hours"
```

### Dashboard Examples

Two dashboard examples are available:

| Dashboard | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [home-assistant-dashboard.yaml](examples/home-assistant-dashboard.yaml) | Production dashboard with motion sensors |
| [home-assistant-dashboard-dev.yaml](examples/home-assistant-dashboard-dev.yaml) | Development dashboard with debug sensors (Free Heap, Loop Time, etc.) |

**How to use:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Add Dashboard**
2. Open the new dashboard and click **Edit** (pencil icon)
3. Click the three dots menu → **Raw configuration editor**
4. Replace ALL content with the YAML from the file (delete the default content first)
5. Click **Save**

> **Note:** If you changed the device name from `espectre`, replace all occurrences of `espectre_` with your device name (e.g., `espectre_living_room_`).

> ⚠️ **Multiple devices?** If you uncommented `name_add_mac_suffix: true` in your YAML, entity names will include the MAC suffix (e.g., `sensor.espectre_a1b2c3_movement_score`). Update the dashboard entities accordingly.

**Production dashboard includes:**
- **Gauge**: Visual representation of movement score with color-coded severity
- **Motion tile**: Current motion state with last changed time
- **Threshold control**: Adjustable detection threshold
- **History graph**: 24-hour view of movement and threshold

**Development dashboard adds:**
- **Free Heap**: Available memory (monitor for leaks)
- **Max Free Block**: Largest contiguous memory block
- **Loop Time**: Main loop execution time

---

## Traffic Generator

The traffic generator creates network packets that trigger CSI callbacks from the WiFi driver. Default rate is **100 pps** (packets per second).

> ⚠️ **Important**: The traffic generator runs **continuously** while the device is powered on, not just during calibration. Each ESPectre device constantly sends packets to generate CSI data for motion detection. See [Network Impact](#network-impact) below to understand the bandwidth and airtime implications for your WiFi network.

```yaml
espectre:
  traffic_generator_rate: 100  # packets per second (0-1000)
  traffic_generator_mode: dns  # dns (default) or ping
```

### Traffic Generator Mode

Two modes are available:

| Mode | Protocol | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `dns` | UDP | Sends DNS queries to gateway:53. Works with most routers. (default) |
| `ping` | ICMP | Sends ICMP echo requests to gateway. Alternative if DNS doesn't work. |

Both modes generate minimal network traffic (<20 bytes per packet). 

**Choosing a mode:**
- Start with `dns` (default) - works with most home routers
- Try `ping` if you get low packet rates - some routers don't respond to root domain DNS queries
- Note: some routers/firewalls may rate-limit or block ICMP ping responses

```yaml
espectre:
  traffic_generator_rate: 100
  traffic_generator_mode: ping  # Use ICMP ping instead of DNS
```

**Community test results** (thanks to [@gasment](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/issues/48)):

| Board | Antenna | Mode | Rate | RSSI | AGC | Result |
|-------|---------|------|------|------|-----|--------|
| ESP32-S3-N16R8 | built-in | DNS | 100 | -15±5 | 15±5 | ✅ |
| ESP32-S3-N16R8 | built-in | PING | 100 | -15±5 | 10±5 | ✅ |
| ESP32-S3-N16R8 | external | DNS | 100 | -10±5 | 5±5 | ✅ |
| ESP32-S3-N16R8 | external | PING | 100 | -5±5 | 5±5 | ✅ |
| ESP32-C6 Super Mini | built-in | DNS | 100 | -20±5 | 15±5 | ✅ |
| ESP32-C6 Super Mini | built-in | PING | 100 | -20±5 | 15±5 | ✅ |
| ESP32-C3 Core | built-in | DNS | 94 | -20±5 | 15±5 | ✅ |
| ESP32-C3 Core | built-in | PING | 94 | -20±5 | 15±5 | ✅ |

Both modes work reliably across different boards and antenna configurations.

For detailed rate recommendations and Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory, see [TUNING.md](TUNING.md#traffic-generator-rate-0-1000-pps).

### Network Impact

Each ESPectre device generates **continuous** WiFi traffic as long as it's powered on. This is required for motion detection to work. Here's the approximate impact per device:

| Rate | Packets/sec | Approximate Bandwidth |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| 50 pps | 50 | ~4.5 KB/s |
| 100 pps (default) | 100 | ~9 KB/s |
| 200 pps | 200 | ~18 KB/s |

For single devices or small deployments (< 5 devices), the default 100 pps has negligible impact on most home networks (typically <1% of available bandwidth).

> ⚠️ **Planning a large deployment?** With many ESPectre devices, the cumulative traffic can consume noticeable WiFi airtime. For example, 10 devices at 100 pps each = 2000 packets/sec (1000 requests + 1000 responses), using approximately 10-15% of airtime. Consider using [External Traffic Mode](#external-traffic-mode) with UDP broadcast to reduce this to ~0.5% airtime.

### External Traffic Mode

You can disable the internal traffic generator and rely on external WiFi traffic:

```yaml
espectre:
  traffic_generator_rate: 0      # Disable internal generator
  publish_interval: 100          # Publish movement score/logs every 100 packets
  evaluation_interval: 25        # Re-evaluate motion state every 25 packets
```

This is useful when:
- You have multiple ESPectre devices and want to reduce total network traffic
- You already have continuous WiFi traffic on your network
- You want centralized control over traffic generation

**Generating external traffic:**

When `traffic_generator_rate: 0`, ESPectre opens a UDP listener on **port 5555**. Send UDP packets to this port to generate CSI data.

Use the standalone Python script: [`espectre_traffic_generator.py`](examples/espectre_traffic_generator.py)

**Configuration:** Edit the script and set your device IP(s):

```python
TARGETS = ['192.168.1.255']  # Broadcast address (recommended for multiple devices)
# TARGETS = ['192.168.1.100', '192.168.1.101']  # Or list specific device IPs
PORT = 5555
RATE = 100  # packets per second (recommended: 100)
```

> ⚠️ **ESP32 (original) limitation:** The CSI driver on ESP32 has a known issue where it doesn't detect traffic that was already flowing when CSI was enabled. You must start the external traffic generator **after** the ESP32 connects to WiFi. Additionally, broadcast mode is not supported - use unicast (specific device IP) instead. ESP32-C3, ESP32-C5, ESP32-C6, and ESP32-S3 don't have these limitations. See [espressif/esp-csi#247](https://github.com/espressif/esp-csi/issues/247) for details.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 espectre_traffic_generator.py run      # Foreground (Ctrl+C to stop)
python3 espectre_traffic_generator.py start    # Background daemon
python3 espectre_traffic_generator.py stop     # Stop daemon
python3 espectre_traffic_generator.py status   # Check if running
```

**Home Assistant (Docker) note:**

The script starts the background process using `subprocess.Popen` (no `fork()`), which avoids the deprecation warning emitted by Python in multi-threaded Home Assistant environments.

Run on any device on the network: Raspberry Pi, NAS, Home Assistant server, etc.

**Home Assistant integration:**

Copy the script to `/config/python_scripts/espectre_traffic_generator.py` and add to `configuration.yaml` (see [command_line integration docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/command_line/)):

```yaml
command_line:
  - switch:
      name: "ESPectre Traffic Generator"
      command_on: "python3 /config/python_scripts/espectre_traffic_generator.py start"
      command_off: "python3 /config/python_scripts/espectre_traffic_generator.py stop"
      command_state: "python3 /config/python_scripts/espectre_traffic_generator.py status"
      value_template: '{{ "Running" in value }}'
      unique_id: espectre_traffic_generator
```

This creates a `switch.espectre_traffic_generator` entity you can toggle from dashboards or use in automations.

<details>
<summary><b>Why UDP instead of ping?</b></summary>

You might wonder why we don't just use `ping -b` (broadcast ping) for external traffic. While ping works for CSI generation, UDP has significant advantages:

| Aspect | Ping broadcast | UDP broadcast |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Response traffic | Yes (ICMP Echo Reply from each device) | None |
| Network overhead | N+1 packets (1 request + N replies) | 1 packet |
| Root required | Yes (for broadcast and high-rate) | No |

For 10 devices at 100 pps, ping broadcast generates 1100 packets/sec (100 requests + 1000 replies), while UDP broadcast generates only 100 packets/sec total.

</details>

### Network Impact: Internal vs External Traffic

**Packet sizes by mode:**

| Mode | Payload | IP packet | On-wire (with MAC) |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| DNS (default) | 17 bytes | 45 bytes | ~75 bytes |
| Ping | 8 bytes | 28 bytes | ~58 bytes |
| External UDP | 3 bytes | 31 bytes | ~61 bytes |

*On-wire size includes WiFi MAC header (~30 bytes). Actual size varies with encryption and PHY rate.*

**Comparison for 10 devices at 100 pps:**

| Approach | Total packets/sec | Total airtime |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Internal traffic generator (DNS) | 1000 + 1000 replies | ~14% |
| Internal traffic generator (Ping) | 1000 + 1000 replies | ~11% |
| **UDP broadcast (recommended)** | **100** | **~0.5%** |

UDP broadcast is the most efficient option for multi-device deployments: one packet reaches all devices, with no response traffic.

<details>
<summary><b>What is airtime?</b></summary>

Airtime is the percentage of time the WiFi channel is occupied by transmissions. Since WiFi is a shared medium, only one device can transmit at a time.

Each packet occupies the channel for:
- **Transmission time**: packet size / PHY rate (e.g., 60 bytes at 54 Mbps ≈ 9 µs)
- **Protocol overhead**: preamble, inter-frame spacing, ACK (~40 µs)

At 100 pps with ~50 µs per packet: **airtime = 0.5%**

High airtime (>30-50%) causes network congestion, increased latency, and packet loss. The UDP broadcast approach keeps airtime minimal even with many ESPectre devices.

## Auto-Calibration (MVS only)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The room must be **still** during the first 10 seconds after boot. Movement during calibration will result in poor detection accuracy!

Auto-calibration applies only to MVS mode. ML mode uses fixed subcarriers from pre-trained weights and skips this phase.

ESPectre automatically calibrates in two phases:

1. **Gain Lock** (~3 seconds, 300 packets): Stabilizes AGC/FFT for consistent amplitudes
2. **NBVI Band Calibration** (~7.5 seconds, 10 × `window_size` packets): Selects optimal 12-subcarrier band and calculates adaptive threshold

With default `segmentation_window_size: 75`, the calibration collects 750 packets. If you change the window size, the calibration buffer adjusts automatically.

Room must be quiet during the entire ~10 second calibration.

**Sensor placement:** Position the sensor 3-8 meters from your access point for optimal performance. See [Sensor Placement](TUNING.md#sensor-placement) in the Tuning Guide for details.

**Gain lock modes:** The `gain_lock` parameter (`auto`/`enabled`/`disabled`) controls AGC stabilization. See [Gain Lock](TUNING.md#gain-lock) in the Tuning Guide.

**Runtime recalibration:** You can trigger recalibration from Home Assistant using the Calibrate switch (`switch.espectre_calibrate`). The switch is automatically disabled during calibration to prevent accidental interruption. For a complete reset, erase flash and re-flash.

## Custom Hardware Configuration

ESPectre now provides example configurations for all ESP32 variants with CSI support. If you need to customize further, use these guidelines:

### Automatic sdkconfig options

ESPectre automatically sets all required and recommended sdkconfig options. You don't need to manually configure anything in most cases.

The component automatically configures:

| Option | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_CSI_ENABLED` | `y` | Enable CSI (mandatory) |
| `CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` | `n` | Disable power management |
| `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_STA_DISCONNECTED_PM_ENABLE` | `n` | Disable disconnected PM |
| `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_AMPDU_TX_ENABLED` | `n` | More CSI callbacks |
| `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_AMPDU_RX_ENABLED` | `n` | More CSI callbacks |
| `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM` | `128` | Larger RX buffer |
| `CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ` | `1000` | 1ms tick for precise timing |

### Platform-specific options (optional)

You only need to add sdkconfig options for platform-specific features:

```yaml
esp32:
  variant: ESP32C6  # or ESP32S3, etc.
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    version: 5.5.1
    sdkconfig_options:
      # CPU frequency (platform-dependent)
      CONFIG_ESP_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ: "160"  # 160 for C6, 240 for S3
      
      # PSRAM (if available on your board)
      # CONFIG_ESP32S3_SPIRAM_SUPPORT: y
```

**Reference:** For advanced sdkconfig tuning see official Espressif documentation: [ESP32 WiFi](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/wifi.html#how-to-configure-parameters).

---

## Flash Size and Partitions

> **Minimum requirement: 4MB flash.** ESPectre fits comfortably in 4MB with full OTA support. Larger flash (8MB/16MB) is only useful for additional components (like `bluetooth_proxy`) or future ML features planned for v3.x.

### ESPectre Flash Footprint

ESPectre itself is very lightweight. The actual code overhead is minimal:

| Configuration | Flash | RAM | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-----|-------|
| ESPHome base + provisioning | 1,464 KB | 49.9 KB | BLE, captive portal, improv |
| ESPectre production | 1,535 KB | 50.0 KB | Full featured |
| **ESPectre overhead** | **~70 KB** | **88 bytes** | Just the CSI code |

The ESPectre component adds only **~70KB of Flash** and less than **100 bytes of RAM**. The majority of flash usage comes from standard ESPHome components (WiFi, API, OTA, provisioning).

### Custom Partition Table

ESPectre includes a custom partition table (`partitions.csv`) that is automatically applied during compilation. This partition table:

- Supports **OTA updates** (dual app partitions)
- Includes **SPIFFS** for calibration buffer (320KB, used during boot only)
- App partition size: **~1.8MB** per slot

```
# ESPectre Partition Table (4MB flash)
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,   Size
nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,   0x5000
otadata,  data, ota,     0xe000,   0x2000
app0,     app,  ota_0,   0x10000,  0x1D0000   # ~1.8MB
app1,     app,  ota_1,   0x1E0000, 0x1D0000   # ~1.8MB
spiffs,   data, spiffs,  0x3B0000, 0x50000    # 320KB
```

### Combining with Other Components

If you want to add ESPectre to an existing ESPHome configuration with other heavy components, be aware that ESPectre's partition table may override your existing partitions.

**To use your own partition table**, you can override it in your YAML using an **absolute path**:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: my-device
  platformio_options:
    board_build.partitions: /path/to/partitions_custom.csv
```

Then create the `partitions_custom.csv` file at that location.

**Example for 4MB flash** (no OTA, ~3.7MB for app):

```
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size
nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x5000,
phy_init, data, phy,     0xe000,  0x1000,
app0,     app,  factory, 0x10000, 0x3C0000,
spiffs,   data, spiffs,  0x3D0000,0x30000,
```

**Example for 8MB flash** (no OTA, ~7.7MB for app):

```
# Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,   Size
nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,   0x5000,
phy_init, data, phy,     0xe000,   0x1000,
app0,     app,  factory, 0x10000,  0x7C0000,
spiffs,   data, spiffs,  0x7D0000, 0x30000,
```

**Notes**:
- SPIFFS is required. ESPectre uses it as a temporary buffer during calibration. Removing SPIFFS will cause the component to fail during initialization.
- If you remove OTA partitions, you must also remove the `ota:` section from your YAML (OTA updates won't work without the partitions).

## BLE Control API (Optional)

ESPectre can expose a BLE telemetry/control channel for custom integrations, even without Home Assistant.

For the complete protocol reference (UUIDs, commands, limits, and frame examples), see [docs/game/README.md#communication-protocol](docs/game/README.md#communication-protocol).

Minimal setup:

```yaml
espectre:
  ble_channel_enabled: auto
  ble_telemetry_interval_ms: 40

esp32_ble_server:
  id: espectre_ble_server
  services:
    - uuid: "d33ff46b-2203-4775-bc6f-b3a2c36af8f0"
      advertise: true
      characteristics:
        - id: espectre_ble_telemetry
          uuid: "119d5cac-48da-4bd9-bfc3-169805868258"
          notify: true
        - id: espectre_ble_sysinfo
          uuid: "c8c89ffa-c401-461f-9ffc-942fa04adfe3"
          read: true
          notify: true
          value: ""
        - id: espectre_ble_control
          uuid: "33ed9214-a8d7-40e8-82d1-c82747dcdc71"
          write: true
          write_no_response: true
```

Use this channel with any standard BLE client by implementing the same UUID/profile contract.

If you do not use BLE integrations, you can remove the `esp32_ble_server:` section entirely. With `ble_channel_enabled: auto` (default), ESPectre will keep the BLE channel disabled when no BLE server is configured.

This can slightly reduce runtime overhead (RAM/CPU usage and BLE radio activity), which may be useful on constrained boards or when you only use Home Assistant entities.

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi protocol/bandwidth shows "unavailable"

On some targets or band modes, the WiFi driver may not expose protocol/bandwidth values through all read APIs. In this case, ESPectre logs:

```
WiFi Protocol: unavailable (...)
WiFi Bandwidth: unavailable (...)
```

This is expected for unsupported read paths and does not necessarily indicate a WiFi connection failure.

### CSI packet length warnings (`wrong SC count`)

ESPectre expects HT20 CSI payloads mapped to `128 bytes` (64 subcarriers). Runtime normalization already handles common alternate lengths:

- `256 -> 128` (double HT-LTF / STBC-like packet)
- `228 -> 114 -> 128` (double short HT estimate, then remap)
- `114 -> 128` (57-subcarrier short HT estimate remapped to 64)

If you still see repeated `Filtered ... wrong SC count` warnings, packets are likely arriving in another unsupported format. In that case, keep an eye on the logged metadata (`ch`, `bb`/`sig_mode`, `est_len`) and open an issue with logs and target chip/AP details.

### No motion detection

1. **Verify traffic generator is enabled** (`traffic_generator_rate > 0`)
2. Check WiFi is connected (look for IP address in logs)
3. Wait for band calibration to complete (~10 seconds after boot)
4. Adjust `segmentation_threshold` (try 0.5-2.0 for more sensitivity)

### False positives

1. Increase `segmentation_threshold` (try 2.0-5.0)
2. Check for interference sources (fans, AC, moving curtains)
3. Increase `segmentation_window_size` for more stable detection

### Calibration fails (MVS only)

Applies only when `detector_algorithm: mvs` (default). The `ml` detector does not use NBVI calibration.

1. Ensure room is quiet during calibration (first 10 seconds after boot)
2. Check traffic generator is running
3. Verify WiFi connection is stable

**Note:** If band selection fails, the system automatically falls back to the shared default subcarriers `[12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52]` with a default threshold of `1.0`. Motion detection still works but may be less optimal. Look for the log message `⚠ Fallback calibration: using default subcarriers`.

### SPIFFS partition not found

If you see `SPIFFS partition could not be found` in logs, ESPectre's partition table was not applied correctly. This commonly happens when:

- Combining ESPectre with other components like `bluetooth_proxy` or `esp32_ble_tracker`
- Using a custom YAML instead of the provided examples
- Another component is overriding the partition table

**Solution:**

1. First, try a full flash erase and reflash:
   ```bash
   # Erase flash completely (replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your port)
   esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
   # Then reflash
   esphome run your-config.yaml
   ```
   Or use the ESPHome dashboard: click the three dots menu → "Install" → "Erase device before installing".

2. If the problem persists, create a custom partition table that includes SPIFFS. See the "Combining with Other Components" section above for examples.

### Unstable detection with mesh networks

If you have a mesh WiFi network, the sensor may roam between access points causing CSI inconsistencies. Lock it to a specific AP using the BSSID.

**For development files** (`espectre-*-dev.yaml`):
1. Add `wifi_bssid` to your `secrets.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   wifi_bssid: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
   ```
2. Uncomment the `bssid` line in your config file:
   ```yaml
   wifi:
     networks:
       - ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
         password: !secret wifi_password
         bssid: !secret wifi_bssid
   ```

**For production files** (`espectre-*.yaml` with provisioning):
Add the BSSID directly after configuring WiFi, or use the ESPHome dashboard to edit the configuration.

To find your AP's BSSID:
- Check your router's admin page
- Use a WiFi analyzer app on your phone
- Look in ESPectre logs after connection (shows connected BSSID)

### ESP32-C3 Super Mini issues

If you're using an ESP32-C3 Super Mini (popular budget boards from AliExpress/Temu):

1. **No logs visible via USB**: ESPHome defaults to native USB Serial/JTAG on C3, but boards with external USB-UART bridges (like CH343, CP2102) need explicit UART0 configuration. Add this to your YAML:
   ```yaml
   logger:
     hardware_uart: UART0
   ```

2. **Calibration takes very long or fails**: Set `traffic_generator_rate: 94` or lower. Values of 95+ cause calibration to hang for 90+ minutes.

3. **Flash fails or board doesn't respond**: Some cheap clones don't support QIO flash mode. Add this to your YAML:
   ```yaml
   esphome:
     platformio_options:
       board_build.flash_mode: dio
   ```

### Flash failed

1. Hold BOOT button on ESP32
2. Press RESET button
3. Release BOOT button
4. Run flash command again

### View logs

```bash
# Via USB
esphome logs <your-config>.yaml

# Via network (after first flash)
esphome logs <your-config>.yaml --device espectre.local
```
